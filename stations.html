He spent his childhood digging around in the fossil-rich earth of Montana, as his father was involved in the gravel-extraction business. By the age of eight he was rewarded with his first big treasure – a real piece of dinosaur bone. As Jack's fossil collection grew, so did his passion for palaeontology. But he struggled at school, where severe undiagnosed dyslexia led his teachers and parents to write him off as lazy and spoiled. He pushed on regardless and in 1978 made a life-changing find: the world's first baby-dinosaur skeletons, and evidence that dinosaur parents cared for and raised their young like many modern birds. The discovery made front-page headlines around the world, and led to awards and accolades Jack had never thought possible. It also brought him to the attention of author Michael Crichton, who based a lead character in his hit book, Jurassic Park, on Jack. And when the call came from Stephen Spielberg to come and advise on the movie version, his fame as a dinosaur expert hit a whole new level. Jack was then himself inspired by the movie, and supervised one of his students in extracting DNA from a T. rex. It didn't work – but it led to his current 'Dino Chicken' project, where he is discovering how to bring ancient dinosaur features back to life in modern birds so he can finally have a pet dinosaur of his own.\n\nPresenter: Asya Fouks\t\nProducer: Anna Lacey and Lucy Davies\n\nGet in touch: outlook@bbc.com or WhatsApp +44 330 678 2707\n\n(Photo: Palaeontologist Jack Horner on a sandy and rocky dig site, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and an orange shirt and a man in the background looking at fossils.

The show brings together more than 140 works from 70 different lenders and reunites the sections of Angelico's great altarpieces, scattered when Napoleon closed the city's churches and convents in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, now fully restored and seen together for the first time in two hundred years. \n\nCarl takes Maria Margaronis through the process of mounting such a massive exhibition from conception to grand opening.

to climate change and all the heat absorbed by the streets and buildings. But Stuttgart in Germany has been tackling this by carefully studying local wind patterns. Using the natural airflow they are cooling the city by creating corridors of wind from the surrounding hills.  It’s an idea which is being copied by cities around the world such as Singapore. There we see how new buildings are being designed to allow a breeze to flow despite the continued development.\n\nPeople Fixing The World from the BBC is about brilliant solutions to the world's problems.

He was stabbed twice in the back with a screwdriver. The physical wounds healed quickly but the mental scars took a lot longer. Dan met his attacker two years later as part of a restorative justice programme, and while he got the apology he needed the panic attacks and fear continued. What helped him was writing about that day. \n\nHe has gone on to perform his poem about the stabbing hundreds of times and earned himself a huge following for his work as a spoken word artist and musician. He writes primarily for what he calls a lost generation - young adults who grew up in an age of social media, inundated with options, comparisons and aspirations. He also now writes a lot about love.\n\nDan's poetry collection is called I Don't Want To Settle.

He was stabbed twice in the back with a screwdriver. The physical wounds healed quickly but the mental scars took a lot longer. Dan met his attacker two years later as part of a restorative justice programme, and while he got the apology he needed the panic attacks and fear continued. What helped him was writing about that day. \n\nHe has gone on to perform his poem about the stabbing hundreds of times and earned himself a huge following for his work as a spoken word artist and musician. He writes primarily for what he calls a lost generation - young adults who grew up in an age of social media, inundated with options, comparisons and aspirations. He also now writes a lot about love.\n\nDan's poetry collection is called I Don't Want To Settle. He will be on tour in Europe and the US in October and November.\n\nPresenter: Jo Fidgen\nProducer: Andrea Kennedy\n\nGet in touch: outlook@bbc.com or WhatsApp +44 330 678 2707\n\nGet in touch: outlook@bbc.com or WhatsApp +44 330 678 2707\n\n(Photo: Dan Whitlam with short red hair stares seriously straight into the camera.

to climate change and all the heat absorbed by the streets and buildings. But Stuttgart in Germany has been tackling this by carefully studying local wind patterns. Using the natural airflow they are cooling the city by creating corridors of wind from the surrounding hills.  It’s an idea which is being copied by cities around the world such as Singapore. There we see how new buildings are being designed to allow a breeze to flow despite the continued development.\n\nPeople Fixing The World from the BBC is about brilliant solutions to the world's problems.

The show brings together more than 140 works from 70 different lenders and reunites the sections of Angelico's great altarpieces, scattered when Napoleon closed the city's churches and convents in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, now fully restored and seen together for the first time in two hundred years. \n\nCarl takes Maria Margaronis through the process of mounting such a massive exhibition from conception to grand opening.  In the restorers' studios she hears how new technologies are revealing the limpid colours of paintings once thought beyond repair. And in the stillness of the San Marco convent Carl explains how Angelico's intimate, deeply humane frescos guided the friars' meditation and spiritual life, and how he fell in love with the artist's work nearly fifty years ago.  Music from 15th century Florence courtesy of Piffaro, The Renaissance Band.\n\nPresented and produced by Maria

He was stabbed twice in the back with a screwdriver. The physical wounds healed quickly but the mental scars took a lot longer. Dan met his attacker two years later as part of a restorative justice programme, and while he got the apology he needed the panic attacks and fear continued. What helped him was writing about that day. \n\nHe has gone on to perform his poem about the stabbing hundreds of times and earned himself a huge following for his work as a spoken word artist and musician. He writes primarily for what he calls a lost generation - young adults who grew up in an age of social media, inundated with options, comparisons and aspirations. He also now writes a lot about love.\n\nDan's poetry collection is called I Don't Want To Settle. He will be on tour in Europe and the US in October and November.\n\nPresenter: Jo Fidgen\nProducer: Andrea Kennedy\n\nGet in touch: outlook@bbc.com or WhatsApp +44 330 678 2707\n\nGet in touch: outlook@bbc.com or WhatsApp +44 330 678 2707\n\n(Photo: Dan Whitlam with short red hair stares seriously straight into the camera.

Hamayun.","medium":"A spiritual comment and prayer to start the day with Saarah Hamayun.","long":"A spiritual comment and prayer to start the day with Saarah Hamayun\n\nSeveral years ago, I visited Rome with my mum and sister; we were wandering through the alleyways towards a crowded square when something – or someone- caught my eye. I saw a man who had no limbs sitting on the ground, beside him sat a nun and she was feeding him with a spoon. Around them the square was alive with people, drinking espresso, taking photos, busy with their day, nobody else really noticed them. \n\nI watched how her attention was fixed as she patiently waited between each spoonful, surrounded by indifference, they shared a moment of grace that belonged only to them. I believe there is something very noble in the lives of those who devote themselves to helping others. It requires a great deal of sacrifice of worldly comforts to serve God from the moment you wake up to when you sleep at night. And yet, the most striking aspect is not the sacrifice itself, but the humility with which it is offered. True devotion, I realised that day, is not measured by grandeur or fame, but by silent, selfless love. \n\nThough we hold tightly to our comforts, there is a lesson for all of us in the tenderness she embodied - To care for others, to show compassion and kindness is the greatest form of devotion. The truest service often happens when no one is watching, in those moments, we act not for glory, but simply because love compels us.\n\nI pray that we might cultivate such compassion in our own lives and show loving care to those around us without seeking recognition or reward, even in the smallest acts - a cup of tea, a hug, a listening ear. These small acts feed our spirit, connect us to one another and brings us closer to the divine. Let our daily acts of love become like quiet hymns of gratitude echoing softly in the lives we touch. \n\nAmen"},"duration":"00:02:00","indexImage":{"type":"indexImage","model":{"blocks":{"src":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m607ll.jpg"}}},"hasOnDemand":false,"advertising":true,"tritonStationId":1192093,"versions":[]}},{"id":"p0m6d5ft","title":"21/10/25 Welfare report on CO2 and the slaughter of pigs; producing cider","synopsis":"Animal welfare experts call for halt to slaughter of pigs with carbon dioxide.","startTime":"2025-10-21T04:45:00.000Z","endTime":"2025-10-21T05:00:00.000Z","brand":{"title":"Farming Today","id":"b006qj8q","path":"/audio/brand/b006qj8q"},"series":{"title":null,"id":null,"path":null},"episode":{"id":"m002l384","title":"21/10/25 Welfare report on CO2 and the slaughter of pigs; producing cider","path":"/audio/play/m002l384","programmesUrl":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002l384","synopses":{"short":"Animal welfare experts call for halt to slaughter of pigs with carbon dioxide.","medium":"Animal welfare experts say pigs shouldn't be slaughtered with carbon dioxide as it causes them suffering - 90% of pigs in England and Wales are killed using CO2.","long":"An independent review of the way pigs are slaughtered has called for the use of carbon dioxide gassing to be prohibited, because it causes too much distress and pain to the animals. 90% of pigs reared in England and Wales are slaughtered this way.

He first moved to Belfast to pursue research in photochemistry at Queen’s University. Inspired by his grandmother’s struggle with high blood pressure he engineered a unique sodium photosensor by marrying fluorescent molecules with chemical receptors. As a result of his international collaborations, a commercial, portable sensor was developed to detect salts and minerals in the blood. Its speed of analysis has since saved countless lives and improved healthcare around the world. \n\nAP talks to Jim Al-Khalili about his passion for engineering molecules and how his photochemical innovations have since crossed into computer science. They’ve been developed to perform molecular computations far inside the human body  - where silicon microchips fear to tread.

Despite this, snakes are remarkable animals: the death adder can strike and return to position in just 0.15 seconds.\n\nBut snake populations are in sharp decline due to habitat loss, roads, and climate change. Some species, like the Round Island Burrowing Boa, are already extinct, while others, such as the harmless Ornate Ground Snake, number fewer than twenty.

Do people deepen their faith during periods of immense suffering, or turn away from religion? \n\nFor this edition of Heart and Soul, Naomi Scherbel-Ball explores how, two years on since the October 7th attacks, hostages and their families see their lives and their faith.\n\nMany of those held hostage in Gaza come from the kibbutzim, largely secular communities that border Gaza, or were taken from the Nova music festival. Some of those released have spoken about reconnecting with their Jewish faith, with one female hostage even translating her prayers into Arabic so she would be allowed to continue to pray by her captors. Others speak of the strength they found in their family, the kibbutzim movement and community.\n\n65-year-old American-Israeli Keith Siegel, who was kidnapped with his wife Aviva, explains how his connection to Judaism deepened during nearly 500 days in captivity. On his release, his daughter asked what he would like for their first family shabbat meal together after nearly 500 days. “What I want most is a kippah and a kiddush cup”, he answered, referring to the head covering worn by observant Jewish men and the symbolic cup that is held during the Friday night blessing in Judaism. Now back with his family in Israel, he says his heart is not whole until the remaining hostages return.\n\nProduced and Presented by Naomi Scherbel-Ball\nExecutive Producer: Rajeev Gupta\nEditor: Chloe Walker"},"duration":"00:30:00","indexImage":{"type":"indexImage","model":{"blocks":{"src":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m7dbf3.jpg"}}},"hasOnDemand":false,"advertising":true,"tritonStationId":1192093,"versions":[]}},{"id":"p0m6d56d","title":"When Kevin Met Sadie","synopsis":"Chris Page explores the influence of Joan Lingard’s Kevin \u0026 Sadie novels on young readers.","startTime":"2025-10-21T15:00:00.000Z","endTime":"2025-10-21T15:30:00.000Z","brand":{"title":"Artworks","id":"p0kpj46q","path":"/audio/brand/p0kpj46q"},"series":{"title":null,"id":null,"path":null},"episode":{"id":"m002l355","title":"When Kevin Met Sadie","path":"/audio/play/m002l355","programmesUrl":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002l355","synopses":{"short":"Chris Page explores the influence of Joan Lingard’s Kevin \u0026 Sadie novels on young readers.","medium":"Chris Page first read Joan Lingard’s Kevin and Sadie novels as a boy. He hears from readers in Northern Ireland about how the stories have shaped their understanding of the past.","long":"At the beginning of the Troubles, an author called Joan Lingard decided to write a series of novels for young people about a Catholic boy named Kevin and a Protestant girl called Sadie. Set initially in 1970s Belfast, the stories were some of the first written for young people about the conflict in Northern Ireland. BBC Ireland Correspondent Chris Page first read them as a boy and they’ve stayed with him ever since. He hears from generations of readers in Northern Ireland about how the novels shaped their understanding of the place they were from. \n\nHe starts in Bangor, near where he grew up, with his friend Ann-Marie Foster who first read the novels in the 1970s. Lingard’s eldest daughter Kersten England tells him how Joan Lingard’s childhood inspired the novels and about how an unlikely visitor shaped their first pages. Writer Jan Carson sits down with Chris in front of Lingard’s manuscripts held at the Linen Hall Library in central Belfast to explore Lingard's continued influence on writers in Northern Ireland. \n\nChris follows in the footsteps of Kevin and Sadie, walking down the towpath by the River Lagan – a place where the characters retreat. He meets Dr Kevin de Ornellas, Lecturer in Renaissance Literature at Ulster University, to discuss Lingard’s use of Shakespearean stories. Dr Kevin talks to Chris about what he made of characterisation when he read the novels as a young boy.\n\nFor Chris, the novels also gave him the idea that young people could strike out for a better future. He explores how the five novels progress, visiting students at Integrated College Dungannon, who have studied Joan Lingard’s novels in class. They tell him what they think Kevin and Sadie would have made of Northern Ireland today.\n\nPresenter: Chris Page\nReader: Aoife Moss\nProducer: Camellia Sinclair\nStudio Manager: Ilse Lademann\n\nWith material from:\nJoan Lingard, The Twelfth of July, Hamish Hamilton, 1970\nJoan Lingard, Across the Barricades, Hamish Hamilton, 1972\nJoan Lingard, Into Exile, Hamish Hamilton, 1973\nJoan Lingard, A Proper Place, Hamish Hamilton, 1975\n\nArchive used:\nBook Week NI, BBC Radio Ulster, 27 October 2010; Across the Barricades, BBC Radio Ulster, 8 November 1985; Children in Crossfire, BBC TV, 12 March 1974; Treasure Islands, BBC Radio 4, 11 December 1991; Stark Talk, BBC Radio Scotland, 20 October 2011; The Usual Suspects: Joan Lingard, BBC Radio Scotland, 1998; Kevin and Sadie, BBC Radio Ulster, 11 July 2010"},"duration":"00:30:00","indexImage":{"type":"indexImage","model":{"blocks":{"src":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m7l189.jpg"}}},"hasOnDemand":false,"advertising":true,"tritonStationId":1192093,"versions":[]}},{"id":"p0m6d56g","title":"Should you take naps?","synopsis":"Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken want to know whether napping is good for us.","startTime":"2025-10-21T15:30:00.000Z","endTime":"2025-10-21T16:00:00.000Z","brand":{"title":"What's Up Docs?","id":"m00298p7","path":"/audio/brand/m00298p7"},"series":{"title":null,"id":null,"path":null},"episode":{"id":"m002l357","title":"Should you take naps?","path":"/audio/play/m002l357","programmesUrl":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002l357","synopses":{"short":"Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken want to know whether napping is good for us.","medium":"Chris and Xand explore why we nap, if it’s actually good for us, and whether we should all be making time for it.","long":"Welcome to What’s Up Docs?, the podcast where doctors and identical twins Chris and Xand van Tulleken tackle the confusion around every aspect of our health and wellbeing.\n\nIn this episode, they’re asking, what’s the deal with naps?

His writing is beautiful, unsettling, extraordinarily persuasive.  We know many of his likes and dislikes about people and politics, but facts about his personal life?  Not so much.  \n\nHis memoir of Agricola tells us much fascinating detail about Roman Britain:  that it's an island (the Roman fleet sailed all the way round, just to check), that it's very close to Spain (with only Ireland in between); that invading Anglesey was a great victory for the Romans.  He notes that it rains a lot, but omits to mention the Druids.  He is also, he says, dedicated to writing impartially.  Natalie may disagree.  Who needs evidence when you have Tacitus' persuasive prose?  It's not as if we can cross-check, because so little of the written record of the time survives to us.  Natalie's guest, (modern) historian Dan Snow, finds this hard to fathom.  Her other guest, Professor Llewelyn Morgan, knows it's unwise to lament the lost work.  We should value what remains and hope that some new bits of Tacitus may appear in the future. \n\nAnd it turns out that by boat, Britain IS actually close to Spain.  Travelling overland was hard going in Tacitus' day, so compared to that, the sea journey to Spain was easy.\n\nRock star mythologist’ and reformed stand-up Natalie Haynes is obsessed with the ancient world.

They might be biographical, topographical, mythological or epic, but they are always hilarious, magical and tragic, mystifying and revelatory.

The speed of his illness outstripped that of the NHS and social care, so the majority of nursing fell to Sarah and her husband. They witnessed what happens to the body and spirit, hour by hour, as it approaches death.\n\nDeath of an Ordinary Man is an unstinting account of death by cancer, a reportage into the experience of caring, an exploration of the structural conditions of dying in the UK, and most importantly a testament to David’s life, that of an ordinary man.\n\nUnflinching and profoundly moving, Sarah Perry confronts the taboo surrounding death and how the saddest thing she has ever seen is also the best thing she's ever done.\n\nEpisode Two\nAs concern for David's health grows, Rob persuades him to see

spiritual comment and prayer to start the day with Saarah Hamayun.","long":"A spiritual comment and prayer to start the day with Saarah Hamayun\n\nIn a small village in South Asia, a young Afghan boy once taught me how to make a kite with a plastic bag, two sticks and some string. He then spent the evening teaching me how to make it fly. I ran and leapt and threw it into the air and hung it off the wall and then jumped some more but I couldn’t even get it a metre off the ground; I passed it to him and with a flick of his wrist he skilfully raised the kite until it was just a speck in the dusky sky. I stood watching him guide the kite as it danced on the breeze, the horizon now alive with colourful, rustling tissue-paper kites and the laughter of children rising through the evening air. \n\nThere is an ancient wisdom in life on the Eastern side of the world, where the sense of urgency can be as distant as the highest kite in the sky. Here in contrast, we may struggle to find the time for everything and everyone. We make plans and write lists as if God has granted us the certainty of tomorrow. Too often, we forget to pause. \n\nThere, I found a slower movement of time, a pace in which I can catch up with myself, a place where I no longer neglect myself. The world even seems to breathe slower, and I begin to match its rhythm, as the car twists around the bends of the mountain road and my head is in a haze, my eyelids heavy from travel, even though I can’t bear to miss the view. But my mind and body are at ease, knowing they have time to recharge, a moment away from all the distractions and excess.  \n\nI pray we each give ourselves time to recharge, to listen to our body when it whispers for rest because in the slowing, something sacred happens - the water clears, the heart steadies. May we learn that stillness is not a bad thing, it is healing, and it is renewal. \n\nAmen"},"duration":"00:02:00","indexImage":{"type":"indexImage","model":{"blocks":{"src":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m607ll.jpg"}}},"hasOnDemand":false,"advertising":true,"tritonStationId":1192093,"versions":[]}},{"id":"p0m6d582","title":"22/10/2025","synopsis":"The latest news about food, farming and the countryside.","startTime":"2025-10-22T04:45:00.000Z","endTime":"2025-10-22T05:00:00.000Z","brand":{"title":"Farming Today","id":"b006qj8q","path":"/audio/brand/b006qj8q"},"series":{"title":null,"id":null,"path":null},"episode":{"id":"m002l36f","title":"22/10/2025","path":"/audio/play/m002l36f","programmesUrl":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002l36f","synopses":{"short":"The latest news about food, farming and the countryside.","medium":"The latest news about food, farming and the countryside.","long":""},"duration":"00:15:00","indexImage":{"type":"indexImage","model":{"blocks":{"src":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m2f6hf.jpg"}}},"hasOnDemand":false,"advertising":true,"tritonStationId":1192093,"versions":[]}},{"id":"p0m6d79k","title":"22/10/2025","synopsis":"News and current affairs, including Sports Desk, Weather and Thought for the Day.","startTime":"2025-10-22T05:00:00.000Z","endTime":"2025-10-22T08:00:00.000Z","brand":{"title":"Today","id":"b006qj9z","path":"/audio/brand/b006qj9z"},"series":{"title":null,"id":null,"path":null},"episode":{"id":"m002l3cy","title":"22/10/2025","path":"/audio/play/m002l3cy","programmesUrl":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002l3cy","synopses":{"short":"News and current affairs, including Sports Desk, Weather and Thought for the Day.","medium":"News and current affairs, including Sports Desk, Weather and Thought for the Day.","long":""},"duration":"03:00:00","indexImage":{"type":"indexImage","model":{"blocks":{"src":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m1dy2t.jpg"}}},"hasOnDemand":false,"advertising":true,"tritonStationId":1192093,"versions":[]}},{"id":"p0m6d79p","title":"A traumatised veteran’s unlikely saviour","synopsis":"Veteran Geoff was plagued by PTSD - but an unusual partnership restored his independence.","startTime":"2025-10-22T08:00:00.000Z","endTime":"2025-10-22T08:30:00.000Z","brand":{"title":"Life Changing","id":"m000v5ng","path":"/audio/brand/m000v5ng"},"series":{"title":null,"id":null,"path":null},"episode":{"id":"m002l3d0","title":"A traumatised veteran’s unlikely saviour","path":"/audio/play/m002l3d0","programmesUrl":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002l3d0","synopses":{"short":"Veteran Geoff was plagued by PTSD - but an unusual partnership restored his independence.","medium":"Former soldier Geoff Stear was plagued by PTSD, triggered by the smell of meat.

They witnessed what happens to the body and spirit, hour by hour, as it approaches death.\n\nDeath of an Ordinary Man is an unstinting account of death by cancer, a reportage into the experience of caring, an exploration of the structural conditions of dying in the UK, and most importantly a testament to David’s life, that of an ordinary man.\n\nUnflinching and profoundly moving, Sarah Perry confronts the taboo surrounding death and how the saddest thing she has ever seen is also the best thing she's ever done.\n\nEpisode Three\nDavid's health continues to deteriorate as he finally receives a diagnosis. \n\nReader: Louise Brealey\nAbridged and produced by Karen Rose\nA Sweet Talk production for BBC Radio 4"},"duration":"00:15:00","indexImage":{"type":"indexImage","model":{"blocks":{"src":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m8cvmk.jpg"}}},"hasOnDemand":false,"advertising":true,"tritonStationId":1192093,"versions":[]}},{"id":"p0m6d7bd","title":"22/10/2025","synopsis":"The latest national and international news from BBC Radio 4.","startTime":"2025-10-22T11:00:00.000Z","endTime":"2025-10-22T11:04:00.000Z","brand":{"title":"News Summary","id":"b04fc120","path":"/audio/brand/b04fc120"},"series":{"title":null,"id":null,"path":null},"episode":{"id":"m002l3d8","title":"22/10/2025","path":"/audio/play/m002l3d8","programmesUrl":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002l3d8","synopses":{"short":"The latest national and international news from BBC Radio 4.","medium":"The latest national and international news from BBC Radio 4.","long":""},"duration":"00:04:00","indexImage":{"type":"indexImage","model":{"blocks":{"src":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m4cs7y.jpg"}}},"hasOnDemand":false,"advertising":true,"tritonStationId":1192093,"versions":[]}},{"id":"p0m6d7bg","title":"22/10/2025","synopsis":"News and discussion of consumer affairs","startTime":"2025-10-22T11:04:00.000Z","endTime":"2025-10-22T11:57:00.000Z","brand":{"title":"You and Yours","id":"b006qps9","path":"/audio/brand/b006qps9"},"series":{"title":null,"id":null,"path":null},"episode":{"id":"m002l3db","title":"22/10/2025","path":"/audio/play/m002l3db","programmesUrl":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002l3db","synopses":{"short":"News and discussion of consumer affairs","medium":"News and discussion of consumer affairs","long":""},"duration":"00:53:00","indexImage":{"type":"indexImage","model":{"blocks":{"src":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m1wh8q.jpg"}}},"hasOnDemand":false,"advertising":true,"tritonStationId":1192093,"versions":[]}},{"id":"p0m6d7bj","title":"22/10/2025","synopsis":"The latest weather forecast","startTime":"2025-10-22T11:57:00.000Z","endTime":"2025-10-22T12:00:00.000Z","brand":{"title":"Weather","id":"b007rn05","path":"/audio/brand/b007rn05"},"series":{"title":null,"id":null,"path":null},"episode":{"id":"m002l3dd","title":"22/10/2025","path":"/audio/play/m002l3dd","programmesUrl":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002l3dd","synopses":{"short":"The latest weather forecast","medium":"","long":""},"duration":"00:03:00","indexImage":{"type":"indexImage","model":{"blocks":{"src":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m60fmf.jpg"}}},"hasOnDemand":false,"advertising":true,"tritonStationId":1192093,"versions":[]}},{"id":"p0m6d7bl","title":"22/10/2025","synopsis":"News, analysis and comment from BBC Radio 4","startTime":"2025-10-22T12:00:00.000Z","endTime":"2025-10-22T12:45:00.000Z","brand":{"title":"World at One","id":"b006qptc","path":"/audio/brand/b006qptc"},"series":{"title":null,"id":null,"path":null},"episode":{"id":"m002l3dg","title":"22/10/2025","path":"/audio/play/m002l3dg","programmesUrl":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002l3dg","synopses":{"short":"News, analysis and comment from BBC Radio 4","medium":"","long":""},"duration":"00:45:00","indexImage":{"type":"indexImage","model":{"blocks":{"src":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m46ftc.jpg"}}},"hasOnDemand":false,"advertising":true,"tritonStationId":1192093,"versions":[]}},{"id":"p0m6l81n","title":"3.

He first moved to Belfast to pursue research in photochemistry at Queen’s University. Inspired by his grandmother’s struggle with high blood pressure he engineered a unique sodium photosensor by marrying fluorescent molecules with chemical receptors. As a result of his international collaborations, a commercial, portable sensor was developed to detect salts and minerals in the blood. Its speed of analysis has since saved countless lives and improved healthcare around the world. \n\nAP talks to Jim Al-Khalili about his passion for engineering molecules and how his photochemical innovations have since crossed into computer science. They’ve been developed to perform molecular computations far inside the human body  - where silicon microchips fear to tread.

So is autism still a spectrum, or should we be thinking of it as having multiple different subtypes? Claudia Hammond talks to Professor Uta Frith, who has pioneered autism research for decades, about what this means for how we view autism now. \n\nThe universities of Cambridge and Durham are launching a study to help them unlock the secrets of vivid memory. Postdoctoral researchers Kasia Mojescik and Martha McGill tell Claudia how they plan to find out what makes a memory vivid, why some more memories are more vivid than others, and how people can get involved in their work.\n\nAnd Claudia is joined in the studio by Catherine Loveday, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Westminster.
